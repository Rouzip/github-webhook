# some ideas

- [x] get repo name
- [ ] get repo data from `Github` (place in the `/tmp`)
- [ ] execute `hugo` in the child shell to execute this mission
- [ ] stop `nginx`
- [ ] `mv` the html and imagine to the right folder
- [ ] start `nginx`

## plan

1. try shell.js to execute bash
2. hugo generate html
